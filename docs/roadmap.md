## Road map

Right now, there is in the pipe [the issues marked as ```feature``` on github](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature+sort%3Acomments-desc). We considere their priority to be the number of ```+1``` in the comments of the issues, so __feel free to vote__. You can also [vote on bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/silexlabs/issues) and even [back the features you need with a bounty](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/silexlabs/issues).

You can also [hire one of the contributors](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/blob/master/docs/contributors.md) directly to develop a feature you require for your business.
